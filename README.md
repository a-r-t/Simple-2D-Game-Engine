# Simple 2D Game Engine
I designed this simple 2D Game Engine to allow for students in my classes to be able
to create their own games. That's it. :)

Documentation can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16izNBd8GW0m4ZcNp7zW5igU8q8TG_kdx/view?usp=sharing).

In this repo, the root src folder contains the Game Engine code. The ExampleGameObjects
module contains some pre-made game objects to show how the engine can be used and help you
get started. The ExampleGame module contains an example game using the engine.
